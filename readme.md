#Multiple regimes of robust patterns between network structure and biodiversity.

figs_paper.m produces the figures for the paper using results precomputed and saved in 
data.

To recreate the data an example is provided in example_one_run.m. It calculates the dynamics for 100 matrices and one set of parameters.
Most of the results were computed using a computer cluster because each run of 100 matrices takes hours. The results of the paper are the average of 100 runs.

pers_one_set_v2.m uses pp_integrator_stop_heu.m to integrate  the system based on the stopping time heuristic described in the supplementary information.

In the appendix pp_integrator_fixed_time.m was used to integrate the system for a fixed time.
